# Authentication

As outlined in <a href="https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/grpc-auth-support.md">gRPC Authentication Support</a>, gRPC supports a number of different mechanisms for asserting identity between an client and server. This document provides code samples demonstrating how to provide SSL/TLS encryption support and identity assertions in Java, as well as passing OAuth2 tokens to services that support it.

# Transport Security (TLS)

HTTP/2 over TLS mandates the use of [ALPN](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-tls-applayerprotoneg-05) to negotiate the use of the h2 protocol. ALPN is a fairly new standard and (where possible) gRPC also supports protocol negotiation via [NPN](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-agl-tls-nextprotoneg-04) for systems that do not yet support ALPN.

On Android, use the [Play Services Provider](#tls-on-android). For non-Android systems, use [OpenSSL](#tls-with-openssl).

## TLS on Android

On Android we recommend the use of the [Play Services Dynamic Security Provider](http://appfoundry.be/blog/2014/11/18/Google-Play-Services-Dynamic-Security-Provider) to ensure your application has an up-to-date OpenSSL library with the necessary ciper-suites and a reliable ALPN implementation.

You may need to [update the security provider](https://developer.android.com/training/articles/security-gms-provider.html) to enable ALPN support, especially for Android versions < 5.0. If the provider fails to update, ALPN may not work.

## TLS with OpenSSL

This is currently the recommended approach for using gRPC over TLS (on non-Android systems). 

### Benefits of using OpenSSL

1. **Speed**: In local testing, we've seen performance improvements of 3x over the JDK. GCM, which is used by the only cipher suite required by the HTTP/2 spec, is 10-500x faster.
2. **Ciphers**: OpenSSL has its own ciphers and is not dependent on the limitations of the JDK. This allows supporting GCM on Java 7.
3. **ALPN to NPN Fallback**: if the remote endpoint doesn't support ALPN.
4. **Version Independence**: does not require using a different library version depending on the JDK update.

### Requirements for using OpenSSL

1. Currently only supported by the Netty transport (via netty-tcnative).
2. [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) version >= 1.0.2 for ALPN support, or version >= 1.0.1 for NPN.
3. [netty-tcnative](https://github.com/netty/netty-tcnative) version >= 1.1.33.Fork7 must be on classpath.
4. Supported platforms (for netty-tcnative): `linux-x86_64`, `mac-x86_64`, `windows-x86_64`. Supporting other platforms will require manually building netty-tcnative.

If the above requirements met, the Netty transport will automatically select OpenSSL as the default TLS provider.

### Configuring netty-tcnative

[Netty-tcnative](https://github.com/netty/netty-tcnative) is a fork of [Apache Tomcat's tcnative](http://tomcat.apache.org/native-doc/), a JNI wrapper around OpenSSL.

Netty uses classifiers when deploying to [Maven Central](http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/netty/netty-tcnative/) to provide distributions for the various platforms. On Linux it should be noted that OpenSSL uses a different soname for Fedora derivatives than other Linux releases. To work around this limitation, netty-tcnative deploys two separate versions for linux.

Classifier | Description
---------------- | -----------
windows-x86_64 | Windows distribution
osx-x86_64 | Mac distribution
linux-x86_64 | Used for non-Fedora derivatives of Linux
linux-x86_64-fedora | Used for Fedora derivatives

*NOTE: Make sure you use a version of netty-tcnative >= 1.1.33.Fork7.  Prior versions only supported NPN and only Fedora-derivatives were supported for Linux.*

#### Getting netty-tcnative from Maven

In Maven, you can use the [os-maven-plugin](https://github.com/trustin/os-maven-plugin) to help simplify the dependency.

```xml
<project>
  <dependencies>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>io.netty</groupId>
      <artifactId>netty-tcnative</artifactId>
      <version>1.1.33.Fork9</version>
      <classifier>${tcnative.classifier}</classifier>
    </dependency>
  </dependencies>

  <build>
    <extensions>
      <!-- Use os-maven-plugin to initialize the "os.detected" properties -->
      <extension>
        <groupId>kr.motd.maven</groupId>
        <artifactId>os-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>1.4.0.Final</version>
      </extension>
    </extensions>
    <plugins>
      <!-- Use Ant to configure the appropriate "tcnative.classifier" property -->
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-antrun-plugin</artifactId>
        <executions>
          <execution>
            <phase>initialize</phase>
            <configuration>
              <exportAntProperties>true</exportAntProperties>
              <target>
                <condition property="tcnative.classifier"
                           value="${os.detected.classifier}-fedora"
                           else="${os.detected.classifier}">
                  <isset property="os.detected.release.fedora"/>
                </condition>
              </target>
            </configuration>
            <goals>
              <goal>run</goal>
            </goals>
          </execution>
        </executions>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
</project>
```

#### Getting netty-tcnative from Gradle

Gradle you can use the [osdetector-gradle-plugin](https://github.com/google/osdetector-gradle-plugin), which is a wrapper around the os-maven-plugin.

```gradle
buildscript {
  repositories {
    mavenCentral()
  }
  dependencies {
    classpath 'com.google.gradle:osdetector-gradle-plugin:1.4.0'
  }
}

// Use the osdetector-gradle-plugin
apply plugin: "com.google.osdetector"

def tcnative_classifier = osdetector.classifier;
// Fedora variants use a different soname for OpenSSL than other linux distributions
// (see http://netty.io/wiki/forked-tomcat-native.html).
if (osdetector.os == "linux" && osdetector.release.isLike("fedora")) {
  tcnative_classifier += "-fedora";
}

dependencies {
    compile 'io.netty:netty-tcnative:1.1.33.Fork9:' + tcnative_classifier
}
```

## TLS with JDK (Jetty ALPN/NPN)

**WARNING: DON'T DO THIS!!**

*For non-Android systems, the recommended approach is to use [OpenSSL](#tls-with-openssl). Using the JDK for ALPN is generally much slower and may not support the necessary ciphers for HTTP2.*

*Jetty ALPN brings its own baggage in that the Java bootclasspath needs to be modified, which may not be an option for some environments. In addition, a specific version of Jetty ALPN has to be used for a given version of the JRE. If the versions don't match the negotiation will fail, but you won't really know why. And since there is such a tight coupling between Jetty ALPN and the JRE, there are no guarantees that Jetty ALPN will support every JRE out in the wild.*

*The moral of the story is: Don't use the JDK for ALPN!  But if you absolutely have to, here's how you do it... :)*

---

If not using the Netty transport (or you are unable to use OpenSSL for some reason) another alternative is to use the JDK for TLS.

No standard Java release has built-in support for ALPN today ([there is a tracking issue](https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8051498) so go upvote it!) so we need to use the [Jetty-ALPN](https://github.com/jetty-project/jetty-alpn") (or [Jetty-NPN](https://github.com/jetty-project/jetty-npn) if on Java < 8) bootclasspath extension for OpenJDK. To do this, add a `Xbootclasspath` JVM option referencing the path to the Jetty `alpn-boot` jar.

```sh
java -Xbootclasspath/p:/path/to/jetty/alpn/extension.jar ...
```

Note that you must use the [release of the Jetty-ALPN jar](http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/documentation/current/alpn-chapter.html#alpn-versions) specific to the version of Java you are using.

### JDK Ciphers

Java 7 does not support [the cipher suites recommended](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-http2-17#section-9.2.2) by the HTTP2 specification. To address this we suggest servers use Java 8 where possible or use an alternative JCE implementation such as [Bouncy Castle](https://www.bouncycastle.org/java.html). If this is not practical it is possible to use other ciphers but you need to ensure that the services you intend to call have [allowed out-of-spec ciphers](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/issues/681) and have evaluated the security risks of doing so.

Users should be aware that GCM is [_very_ slow (1 MB/s)](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1135504) before Java 8u60. With Java 8u60 GCM is 10x faster (10-20 MB/s), but that is still slow compared to OpenSSL (~200 MB/s), especially with AES-NI support (~1 GB/s). GCM cipher suites are the only suites available that comply with HTTP2's cipher requirements.

### Configuring Jetty ALPN in Web Containers

Some web containers, such as [Jetty](http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/documentation/current/jetty-classloading.html) restrict access to server classes for web applications. A gRPC client running within such a container must be properly configured to allow access to the ALPN classes. In Jetty, this is done by including a `WEB-INF/jetty-env.xml` file containing the following:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"  encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
<!DOCTYPE Configure PUBLIC "-//Mort Bay Consulting//DTD Configure//EN" "http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/configure.dtd">
<Configure class="org.eclipse.jetty.webapp.WebAppContext">
    <!-- Must be done in jetty-env.xml, since jetty-web.xml is loaded too late.   -->
    <!-- Removing ALPN from the blacklisted server classes (using "-" to remove). -->
    <!-- Must prepend to the blacklist since order matters.                       -->
    <Call name="prependServerClass">
        <Arg>-org.eclipse.jetty.alpn.</Arg>
    </Call>
</Configure>
```
## Enabling TLS on a server

To use TLS on the server, a certificate chain and private key need to be
specified in PEM format. The standard TLS port is 443, but we use 8443 below to
avoid needing extra permissions from the OS.

```java
ServerImpl server = ServerBuilder.forPort(8443)
    // Enable TLS
    .useTransportSecurity(certChainFile, privateKeyFile)
    .addService(TestServiceGrpc.bindService(serviceImplementation))
    .build();
server.start();
```

If the issuing certificate authority is not known to the client then a properly
configured SslContext or SSLSocketFactory should be provided to the
NettyChannelBuilder or OkHttpChannelBuilder, respectively. [Mutual
authentication][] can be configured similarly.

[Mutual authentication]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security#Client-authenticated_TLS_handshake

# gRPC over plaintext

An option is provided to use gRPC over plaintext without TLS. While this is convenient for testing environments, users must be aware of the security risks of doing so for real production systems.

# Using OAuth2

The following code snippet shows how you can call the Google Cloud PubSub API using gRPC with a service account. The credentials are loaded from a key stored in a well-known location or by detecting that the application is running in an environment that can provide one automatically, e.g. Google Compute Engine. While this example is specific to Google and it's services, similar patterns can be followed for other service providers.

```java
// Create a channel to the test service.
ChannelImpl channelImpl = NettyChannelBuilder.forAddress("pubsub.googleapis.com")
    .negotiationType(NegotiationType.TLS)
    .build();
// Get the default credentials from the environment
GoogleCredentials creds = GoogleCredentials.getApplicationDefault();
// Down-scope the credential to just the scopes required by the service
creds = creds.createScoped(Arrays.asList("https://www.googleapis.com/auth/pubsub"));
// Intercept the channel to bind the credential
ClientAuthInterceptor interceptor = new ClientAuthInterceptor(creds, someExecutor);
Channel channel = ClientInterceptors.intercept(channelImpl, interceptor);
// Create a stub using the channel that has the bound credential
PublisherGrpc.PublisherBlockingStub publisherStub = PublisherGrpc.newBlockingStub(channel);
publisherStub.publish(someMessage);
```
